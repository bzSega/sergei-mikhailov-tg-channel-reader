## [0.8.5] - 2026-03-01

**Clear guide for running the skill on a schedule.** The "Isolated Agents & Cron Jobs" section is now a full "Scheduled Tasks & Cron" guide with two approaches: `sessionTarget: "main"` (recommended — reminder-based, works out of the box) and `sessionTarget: "isolated"` (autonomous but requires Docker setup and session file mounting). The agent now explains the trade-offs to the user when setting up a cron task.

### Changed
- `SKILL.md`: replaced "Isolated Agents & Cron Jobs" section with expanded "Scheduled Tasks & Cron" covering both session target modes, configuration examples, and session file caveats
- Agent instruction added: when creating a scheduled task, explain to the user which approach is used and what it means

---

## [0.8.4] - 2026-02-28

**Read what people are saying in the comments.** Add `--comments` to a fetch command and the skill retrieves discussion replies for each channel post — great for sentiment analysis, audience feedback, and topic tracking. Works with both Pyrogram and Telethon backends.

### Added
- `--comments` flag for `fetch` command — fetches discussion replies (comments) for each post in a single channel
- `--comment-limit N` — max comments per post (default 10)
- `--comment-delay N` — seconds between posts when fetching comments (default 3) to avoid rate limits
- Output includes `comments_enabled`, `comments_available` flags and a `comments` array per message with `id`, `date`, `text`, `from_user`
- Channels without a linked discussion group return `comments_available: false` instead of an error

### Changed
- Default `--limit` drops from 100 → 30 when `--comments` is active (token economy — comments produce a lot of output)
- `--comments` is restricted to a single channel; using it with multiple channels returns an actionable error (`comments_multi_channel`)

### Error handling
- FloodWait during comment fetch: auto-retry once if ≤ 60 s, otherwise sets `comments_error` on the affected message and continues
- Media-only comments (no text) are silently skipped
- Anonymous comments return `from_user: null`

---

## [0.8.3] - 2026-02-28

**Posts with images and videos are no longer invisible.** Previously, if a channel post contained a photo or video, the skill could return an empty text field — and the agent would skip it during summarization. Now every message includes `has_media` and `media_type` fields, and the text caption is always captured correctly. Images and videos themselves are not analyzed (no OCR/vision), but their accompanying text is fully preserved.

### Fixed
- Pyrogram: made text extraction from media posts more explicit — `msg.text` and `msg.caption` are now checked separately instead of relying on Python `or` chain
- Both backends: `has_media` (boolean) and `media_type` (string) are now **always** included in the message output — media info is part of every response by default
- `SKILL.md`: removed instruction to "filter out media-only posts" — agents should never skip posts with media as they often contain important text in captions

### Changed
- Replaced `--media` flag with `--text-only` — by default all posts are included (media + text); use `--text-only` to exclude posts with no text (e.g. standalone images/videos without captions)

---

## [0.8.2] - 2026-02-28

**Security hardening after registry review.** The debug script now asks for confirmation before deleting session files, and insecure session-copying instructions have been removed from the docs.

### Fixed
- `debug_auth.py`: added confirmation prompt before deleting `.session` and `.session-journal` files — no more silent deletion
- `SKILL.md`: documented that `debug_auth.py` deletes session files (with confirmation)

### Removed
- Removed `scp` session-copying instructions from `README_TELETHON.md` and `TESTING_GUIDE.md` — copying session files between machines is insecure and grants full Telegram account access

---

## [0.8.0] - 2026-02-28

**Multiple channels no longer cause Telegram to block your account.** Previously, fetching several channels at once sent all requests in parallel — Telegram treated this as flood and rate-limited the session. Now channels are fetched one at a time with a 10-second pause between each, and short rate limits (≤ 60 s) are waited out automatically.

### Changed
- `fetch_multiple` in both Pyrogram and Telethon backends now processes channels **sequentially** instead of in parallel (`asyncio.gather` removed)
- Pyrogram multi-channel fetch uses a **single session** for all channels (previously each channel opened its own session)
- FloodWait auto-retry: if Telegram says "wait N seconds" and N ≤ 60, the skill sleeps and retries once automatically; longer waits still return an error

### Added
- `--delay` flag for `fetch` command — configurable pause between channels (default 10 seconds)

---

## [0.7.2] - 2026-02-28

**Fixed: channels with non-existent usernames no longer crash the skill.** Pyrogram throws a `KeyError` internally when a username like `@disruptors_official` doesn't exist — this wasn't caught before. Now any unrecognized error is handled gracefully and returns a clear JSON response instead of a stack trace.

### Fixed
- Pyrogram `fetch_messages()` and `fetch_info()` now catch `KeyError` from `resolve_peer` / `get_peer_by_username` — maps to `error_type: "not_found"`
- Added generic `except Exception` fallback to both functions (Telethon already had this) — maps to `error_type: "unexpected"` with `action: "report_to_user"`

---

## [0.7.1] - 2026-02-28

**The skill no longer crashes when a channel is private or you've been banned.** Previously, a single channel error would break the whole request. Now the agent gets a clear JSON response with the error type and a suggested next step — remove the channel, wait, or ask you for a new invite link.

### Improved
- Channel error handling: both Pyrogram and Telethon backends now catch `ChannelPrivate`, `ChannelBanned`, `ChatForbidden`, `ChatRestricted`, `UserBannedInChannel`, `InviteHashExpired`, and more
- Errors return structured JSON with `error_type` (access_denied, banned, not_found, invite_expired, flood_wait) and `action` field for agent automation
- `SKILL.md`: updated Error Handling section with error_type/action reference table

---

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-28

**New `tg-reader-check` command — instant diagnostics in one second.** The agent runs it before reading channels and immediately sees whether credentials, session file, and libraries are all in place. If something is wrong, it gets a specific suggestion on how to fix it. No more mysterious errors on first run.

### Added
- `tg-reader-check` command — offline diagnostic that verifies credentials, session files, and backend availability
- Outputs structured JSON with `status`, `credentials`, `session`, `backends`, and `problems` fields
- Stale session detection: warns when config points to an older session while a newer one exists (common after re-auth)
- Shows `config_session_override` and `default_path` when config overrides the default session — helps spot mismatches
- Supports `--config-file` and `--session-file` flags (same as reader commands)
- `SKILL.md`: new "Pre-flight Check" section; agent should run `tg-reader-check` before fetching
- `_find_session_files()` deduplication fix (Python 3.13+ `glob` matches dotfiles with `*`)

---

## [0.6.1] - 2026-02-28

**The skill no longer hangs when the session file is missing.** Previously, a missing file would silently trigger a Telegram re-auth prompt that the agent couldn't handle. Now you get a JSON error explaining where the file was expected, which session files were found on disk, and the exact command to fix it.

### Fixed
- Session file validation: `fetch` and `info` commands now check that the `.session` file exists before connecting, instead of silently triggering a re-auth prompt
- When the session file is missing, both Pyrogram and Telethon backends output a structured JSON error with: expected path, list of found `.session` files in `~` and CWD, and a suggested `--session-file` fix
- `get_config()` now strips `.session` suffix if the user passes a full filename (e.g. `--session-file /path/to/foo.session`), preventing Pyrogram/Telethon from looking for `foo.session.session`

---

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-24

**The skill now works in scheduled tasks (cron) and isolated agents.** If your agent runs on a schedule or inside a sandbox without access to the home directory — just pass explicit paths to the config and session file. Everything works out of the box.

### Added
- `--config-file` flag — pass explicit path to config JSON (overrides `~/.tg-reader.json`)
- `--session-file` flag — pass explicit path to session file (overrides default session path)
- Both flags work with all subcommands (`fetch`, `info`, `auth`) and both backends (Pyrogram, Telethon)
- `SKILL.md`: new "Isolated Agents & Cron Jobs" section with usage examples

### Fixed
- Skill now works in isolated sub-agent environments (e.g. OpenClaw cron with `sessionTarget: "isolated"`) where `~/` is not accessible

---

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-23

**New `tg-reader info` command — learn everything about a channel in a second.** Title, description, subscriber count, and link. Great for checking a channel before reading its posts, or building a list of channels with descriptions.

### Added
- `tg-reader info @channel` — new subcommand to fetch channel title, description, subscriber count and link
- `SKILL.md`: documented `info` command in When to Use, How to Use, and Output Format sections
- `SKILL.md`: `~/.tg-reader.json` recommended as primary credentials method for agent/server environments that don't load `.bashrc`/`.zshrc`

---

## [0.4.3] - 2026-02-23

**Fixed three bugs that could break authentication and post fetching.** If `tg-reader auth` was giving you cryptic errors or posts wouldn't load — update to this version.

### Fixed
- `reader.py`: removed `system_lang_code` from Pyrogram `Client` init — parameter is Telethon-only and caused `TypeError` on auth
- `reader.py`: fixed `TypeError: can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes` when fetching messages — `msg.date` from Pyrogram is UTC-naive, now normalized before comparison with `since`
- `reader.py`: removed iOS device spoofing (`_DEVICE`) — Telegram detects the mismatch between declared client identity and actual behaviour and terminates the session; Pyrogram's default identity is stable

---

## [0.4.2] - 2026-02-23

**Improved documentation for macOS and Linux.** Installation instructions now cover both platforms, including Python virtual environments on Ubuntu/Debian.

### Fixed
- `README.md`: fix `python3 -m reader` fallback to `python3 -m tg_reader_unified`
- `README.md`: add Linux venv install instructions for managed Python environments (Debian/Ubuntu)
- `README.md`: add macOS `~/.zshrc` for `TG_USE_TELETHON` alongside Linux `~/.bashrc`
- `README.md`: update PATH section to cover venv bin path, not just `~/.local/bin`
- `README.md`: add note to confirm phone number with `y` during Pyrogram auth
- `SKILL.md`: add Linux venv install instructions
- `SKILL.md`: add note to confirm phone number with `y` during Pyrogram auth

---

## [0.4.1] - 2026-02-23

**Security hardened.** The session file is now protected with restricted permissions, and secret keys no longer leak into logs.

### Security
- `test_session.py`: replaced partial `api_hash[:10]` print with masked output (`***`) to prevent secret leakage in logs or shared terminals
- `SKILL.md`: added `chmod 600` step after auth to restrict session file permissions

---

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-23

**The skill now integrates correctly with OpenClaw.** Fixed the SKILL.md metadata format so OpenClaw can automatically detect that the skill needs Telegram credentials.

### Fixed
- `SKILL.md` frontmatter converted to single-line JSON as required by OpenClaw spec
- `requires.env` format corrected to array of strings `["TG_API_ID", "TG_API_HASH"]`
- Removed undocumented `requires.python` field from metadata
- Removed optional env vars (`TG_SESSION`, `TG_USE_TELETHON`) from gating filter
- Added missing `primaryEnv: "TG_API_HASH"` for openclaw.json `apiKey` support
- Auth command in setup guide corrected from `python3 -m reader auth` to `tg-reader auth`
- Fallback command in Error Handling corrected to `python3 -m tg_reader_unified`

### Added
- macOS (`~/.zshrc`) credentials setup alongside Linux (`~/.bashrc`) in agent instructions
- `CLAUDE.md` with project context and documentation references for Claude Code

---

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-22

**Added a second engine — Telethon.** If the auth code isn't arriving via Pyrogram or you're hitting connection issues — try Telethon. One command, same result.

### Added
- **Telethon alternative implementation** (`reader_telethon.py`)
- New command `tg-reader-telethon` for users experiencing Pyrogram auth issues
- Comprehensive Telethon documentation (`README_TELETHON.md`)
- Testing guide (`TESTING_GUIDE.md`) with troubleshooting steps
- Session file compatibility notes
- Instructions for copying sessions between machines

### Changed
- Updated `setup.py` to include both Pyrogram and Telethon versions
- Added telethon>=1.24.0 to dependencies
- Enhanced README with Telethon usage section

### Fixed
- Authentication code delivery issues by providing Telethon alternative
- Session management for users with existing Telethon sessions

---

## [0.2.1] - 2026-02-22

**One command `tg-reader` — and the skill picks the best engine automatically.** No need to choose between Pyrogram and Telethon — it just works. But if you want manual control, the `--telethon` flag or an environment variable is at your service.

### Added
- Unified entry point (`tg_reader_unified.py`) for automatic selection between Pyrogram and Telethon
- Support for `--telethon` flag for one-time switch to Telethon
- Support for `TG_USE_TELETHON` environment variable for persistent library selection
- Direct commands `tg-reader-pyrogram` and `tg-reader-telethon` for explicit implementation choice

### Changed
- `tg-reader` command now uses unified entry point instead of direct Pyrogram call
- Updated documentation with library selection instructions
- `setup.py` now includes all three entry points

### Improved
- Simplified process for switching between Pyrogram and Telethon for users
- Better OpenClaw integration — single skill supports both libraries

---

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-22

**Step-by-step setup guide included.** Even if you've never worked with the Telegram API — the guide walks you through creating an app on my.telegram.org all the way to your first request.

### Added
- Detailed Telegram API setup instructions in README
- Agent guidance in SKILL.md for missing credentials
- PATH fix instructions for tg-reader command not found
- Troubleshooting section with real-world errors

---

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-22

**First release! Read Telegram channels straight from the terminal.** Fetch posts from public and private channels for any time window — as JSON for automation or plain text for reading.

### Initial release
- Fetch posts from Telegram channels via MTProto
- Support for multiple channels and time windows
- JSON and text output formats
- Secure credentials via env vars
